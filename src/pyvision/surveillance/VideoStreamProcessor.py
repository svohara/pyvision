'''
This module implements various Video Stream Processors, or VSPs for short.
A VSP is designed to encapsulate a per-frame operation that can be
applied to a video stream. Examples include displaying the image while
overlaying the frame number (SimpleVSP), writing the output of a video
stream to a video file (VideoWriterVSP), and performing motion detection
on each video frame (MotionDetectionVSP).

The general idea is to chain together a VSP sequence, and then attach
the head of the chain to a video's play method. We hope that users will
create and/or contribute many useful subclasses of AbstractVSP.

For example:
import pyvision as pv
vsp_write = pv.VideoWriterVSP('tmp.avi',size=(640,480))
vsp_disp = pv.SimpleVSP(window="Display", nextModule=vsp_write)
vid = pv.Video(sourceFile)
vid.play(window=None, delay=25, onNewFrame=vsp_disp)
'''

VSP_SWALLOW_IMG = -1 #special return onNewFrame to indicate that the frame should be skipped, and not passed downstream

    '''AbstractVSP is the abstract class definition of a
    Video Stream Processor (VSP) object. VSP's are designed to be chained
    together to accomplish processing on a video stream.
